# Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains my data analysis projects and experiments using Python. I will be adding the libraries I am currently using for data analysis and exploring various datasets and techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fatin-israq/data-analysis-with-python.git
   cd data-analysis-with-python
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## What I'm Learning

This repository will server as my learning journey in data analysis with Python. I'm exploring:

- Data manipulation techniques with Pandas
- Numerical computing with NumPy
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Statistical analysis and insights
- Best practices in data science workflows
